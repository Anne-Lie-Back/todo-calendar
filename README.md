# todo-calendar


# A todo list and a calendar.
The user can add, remove and edit todos, and on larger displays the user can view a calendar that shows how many todos each day contains.

The todos are saved in local storage on the users computer, and holidays are fetched from an API and displayed in the calendar.

The calendar can change what month is displayed and the user can click on any day to filter the todos for that day.
